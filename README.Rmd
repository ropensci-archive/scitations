`scitations` - citations for R

`scitations` is meant to make it easy to work with citations, whether in tidy 
format or not, and to convert from various formats to citations, and to various
formts. 

The package introduces a simple S3 class called a `scitation` that we can then
perform many operations with or on.

There are other bibliographic packages out there - this package tries not to 
duplicate their efforts, while striving for a fun to use citation workflow.
